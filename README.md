# telegram-qBot
A bot used to manage queues in a group chat.

>Do you work in a group where organization is the utmost need? Does your message always get buried in the group chat? qBot is the solution for you!

Add this bot to your Telegram group or speak to him in your private chat. It will help you organize your turns, like for asking a question in a group during a meeting, trimming your endless movies list and any step-by-step task you have in mind. Every chat is independent of any other, so you can add it to as many groups as you want.

# Usage
Commands are always preceded by a `/`. Send `/start` in the chat and the bot will greet you. The bot will describe all the commands when you ask it for `/help`.
